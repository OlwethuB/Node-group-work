You asked:
What is the difference between API, REST API, and RESTFUL API? Please use an example for each one of them and include what it stands for.

API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of rules and protocols for building software applications. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style for designing APIs. RESTFUL API is an API that follows the REST architectural style, which means it follows the principles of REST, such as statelessness, caching, and resource-based routing.

Example of REST API: The Twitter API allows developers to access and use Twitter data and functionality in their own applications. Developers can use the API to search for tweets, retrieve user information, and more.

Example of RESTful API: The GitHub API allows developers to access and use GitHub data and functionality in their own applications. Developers can use the API to clone repositories, create new repositories, and more.

Example of API: The Google Maps API allows developers to use Google Maps functionality and data in their own applications. Developers can use the API to display maps, get directions, and more.
